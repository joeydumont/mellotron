# This CMake module attemps to find the Zernike library. Once it is done,     #
# the following will be defined:                                              #
#     - Zernike_FOUND: if system has Zernike and everything is parsed;        #
#     - Zernike_INCLUDE_DIR: folder where headers are.                        #
#     - Zernike_LIBRARY: library against which to link.                       #
#                                                                             #
